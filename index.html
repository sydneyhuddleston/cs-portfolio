            About Me
        </h1>
  
  <h3>
    Who am I?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Hello! My name is Sydney Huddleston, and I am a senior at Summit Shasta High School. My school is located in Daly City, California, where I was born and have lived most of my life.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Where Have I Traveled to?
  </h3>
  <p>
    So far, I have traveled to only seven of the 50 states, a few of them being Hawaii, Texas, and Arizona. I have also been able to visit many attractions such as the Grand Canyon and the Smithsonian Museums. I do enjoy traveling, as I find that
    exploring new places can be very rewarding.
  </p>
  <h3>
    A Few More Fun Facts About Me...
  </h3>
  <p>
   As I stated in the previous question, I love traveling very much. Exploring new places is an ideal weekend for me. My family and I take an annual camping trip every year for about four to five days up in the Plumas National Forest. Every year
    I look forward to that trip which normally comes in the month of August. On the weekends I enjoy going on long hikes with my family, and then going to try a new food or snack after.

  <h3>
    A Few of My Favorite Things...
  </h3>

  <p>
    Two of my favorite things are a strange combo: food and sports.  I enjoy baking, assisting my parents in their cooking endeavors, and learning new recipes.  My other passion is sports, something I love to both participate in and watch. I am a huge fan of both indoor and beach volleyball, both of which are my favorite sports.  I do also participate in basketball, my second favorite sport.  I began playing basketball and volleyball my freshman year of High School, three years ago. This past year, I began to love playing on the beach, as I get to dive into the sand, which could quite possibly be my favorite part of playing.  While it can be tiring, sports are something I love very much.
