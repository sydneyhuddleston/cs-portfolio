        <p>
            Who am I?
            <br>
            Hello! My name is Sydney Huddleston, and I am a senior at 
            Summit Shasta High School. My school is located in Daly
            City, California, where I was born and have lived most of 
            my life.  
            <br>
            Where have I traveled to?
            <br>
            So far, I have traveled to only seven of the 50 states, 
            a few of them being Hawaii, Texas, and Arizona.  I have
            also been able to visit many attractions such as the Grand
            Canyon and the Smithsonian Museums.  I do enjoy traveling,
            as I find that exploring new places can be very rewarding. 
            <br>
            Anything else to know about me?
            <br>
            As I stated in the previous question, I love traveling very
            much.  Exploring new places is an ideal weekend for me. My
            family and I take an annual camping trip every year for 
            about four to five days up in the Plumas National Forest. 
            Every year I look forward to that trip which normally
            comes in the month of August.  On the weekends I enjoy
            going on long hikes with my family, and then going to try a 
            new food or snack after.  
            <br>
            What are two of my most favorite things?
