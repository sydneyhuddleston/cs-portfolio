      <h2>
        <center> Who am I? </center>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Sydney Huddleston, and I am a senior at Summit Shasta High School. My school is located in Daly City, California, where I was born and have lived most of my life.
      </p>
      <h2>
        <center> Where Have I Traveled to? </center>
      </h2>
      <p>
        So far, I have traveled to only seven of the 50 states, a few of them being Hawaii, Texas, and Arizona. I have also been able to visit many attractions such as the Grand Canyon and the Smithsonian Museums. I do enjoy traveling, as I find that exploring
        new places can be very rewarding.

      <h2>
        <center> A Few More Fun Facts About Me... </center>
      </h2>
      <p>
        As I stated in the previous question, I love traveling very much. Exploring new places is an ideal weekend for me. My family and I take an annual camping trip every year for about four to five days up in the Plumas National Forest. Every year I look forward
        to that trip which normally comes in the month of August. On the weekends I enjoy going on long hikes with my family, and then going to try a new food or snack after.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h2>
        <center> A Few of My Favorite Things... </center>
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        Two of my favorite things are a strange combo: food and sports. I enjoy baking, assisting my parents in their cooking endeavors, and learning new recipes. My other passion is sports, something I love to both participate in and watch. I am a huge fan of
        both indoor and beach volleyball, both of which are my favorite sports. I do also participate in basketball, my second favorite sport. I began playing basketball and volleyball my freshman year of High School, three years ago. This past year,
        I began to love playing on the beach, as I get to dive into the sand, which could quite possibly be my favorite part of playing. While it can be tiring, sports are something I love very much.
