            Hardware is the substantial makeup of the computer.  For example, Hardware includes all of the wires and parts needed for the computer to function.

            The Motherboard is the most basic, important part of the computer's hardware.  The Motherboard is where all of the electrical connections between the other parts of the computer is stored.  Think of the Motherboard as the center of the computer, the gathering point for all of the different parts to share their thoughts and communicate with one another.

        <p>
            The Central Processing Unit, also known as "the CPU", is the part of a computer's hardware where most of the calculations the computer makes is made.  The CPU has been nicknamed the "Brain" of the computer, as the CPU gives all of the instructions, no matter how small they are.  There is two parts to the CPU: the Arithmetic Logic Unit (also called the ALU) and the Control Unit (CU).  The ALU produces most of the logical instructions the CPU gives, while the CU communicates the instructions of the CPU to the parts of the hardware in need of instructions.

           <center> RAM </center> 
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Random Access Memory, also known as the RAM, is a place where memories can be stored for quick access.  If comparing the RAM to a human Brain, the RAM would be your short term memory.  After the memories leave your short term memory, they move to your long term memory, or in this case the Hard Drive.  The RAM can be useful when trying to access more information from the applications that are currently in use.  The RAM is typically small and compact in size.  There are two different types of RAM memory: Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) and Static Random Access Memory (SRAM).  The DRAM differs from the SRAM, as it requires a constant supply of power to function, which the SRAM does not need the power supply.  The DRAM is also significantly smaller than the SRAM, as well as being less expensive.  While the lower price and smaller size of the DRAM may be tempting, the SRAM is significantly faster at accessing memory.

        </h3>
        <p>
            The Hard Drive, short for Hard Disk Drive, is the part of the computer responsible for storing memories such as text files or pictures.  The first Hard Drive was created by the company IBM in 1956, and has been greatly modified since then.  Originally very large, a hard drive is now very small in size, typically the size of your hand. The Hard drive may be small in size, but can hold a significant amount of memory.  A Hard Drive stores its memories magnetically, so when the computer is powered off, the memories will still exist.  The units for measuring how much memory a Hard Drive range are typically either Megabytes, Gigabytes, and Terabytes.  Rarely is a Hard Drive measured in Bytes, as the unit is too small.  One Megabyte is one million Bytes, one Gigabyte is one billion Bytes, and one Terabyte is one trillion Bytes.  A Hard Drive functions the entire time the computer is turned on, its disks constantly spinning at high speeds.

            All of these different computer parts communicate through the motherboard, which links all electrical connections between the different parts of hardware.  The motherboard acts as a central meeting place for all of the different hardware parts.

            <center> What is the keyboard, mouse, and monitor? </center>
        </h3>
        <p>
            A keyboard is the portion of the computer that allows you to enter text into documents and control certain aspects of the computer’s features.  A keyboard shares striking similarities to that of a typewriter, as they both have a similar format for keys.  The mouse is a device, typically a USB plugin, that allows you to move the cursor across the screen in order to select links, chunks of text, and much more.  The mouse and the keyboard are very important, as they communicate the user’s needs to the hardware.  The monitor is the display screen, which you are reading this article on.  The monitor displays the application you are using, a result of the hardware working together.
