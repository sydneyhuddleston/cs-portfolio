            Hardware is the substantial makeup of the computer.  For example, Hardware includes all of the wires and parts needed for the computer to function.

            The Central Processing Unit, also known as "the CPU", is the part of a computer's hardware where most of the calcuations the computer makes is made.  The CPU has been nicknamed the "Brain" of the computer, as the CPU gives all of the instructions, no matter how small they are.  There is two parts to the CPU: the Arithmetic Logic Unit (also called the ALU) and the Control Unit (CU).  The ALU produces most of

           RAM

        <p>
            The Random Access Memory, also known as the RAM, is a place where memories can be stored for quick access.  If comparing the RAM to a human Brain, the RAM would be your short term memory.  After the memories leave your short term memory, they move to your long term memory, or in this case the Hard Drive.  The RAM can be useful when trying to access more information from the applications that are currently in use.  The RAM is typicall small and compact in size.  There are two different types of RAM memory: Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) and Static Random Access Memory (SRAM).  The DRAM differs from the SRAM, as it requires a constant supply of power to function, which the SRAM does not need.  The DRAM is also significantly smaller than the SRAM, as well as being less expensive.  While the price and size difference may be tempting, the SRAM is significantly faster at accessing memory than the DRAM is.

            Hard Drive

            The Hard Drive, short for Hard Disk Drive, is the part of the computer responsible for storing memories such as text files or pictures.  The first Hard Drive was created by the company IBM in 1956, and has been greatly modified since then.  Originally very large, a hard drive is now very small in size, typically the size of your hand. The Hard drive may be small in size, but can hold a significant amount of memory.  A Hard Drive stores its memories magnetically, so when the computer is powered off, the memories will still exist.  The units for measuring how much memory a Hard Drive range are typically either Megabytes, Gigabytes, and Terabytes.  Rarely is a Hard Drive measured in Bytes, as the unit is too small.  One Megabyte is one million Bytes, one Gigabyte is one billion Bytes, and one Terabyte is one trillion Bytes.  A Hard Drive functions the entire time the computer is turned on, its disks constantly spinning at high speeds.
